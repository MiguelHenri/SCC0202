Algorithms and Data Structures I
# Summary:
Practicing the implementation of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in C.
  
  
Projects:
- `Travelling Salesman Problem`: "simple" solution to this problem using linked lists. 
- `Set ADT in C`: implementation of the mathematical set, with functions such as union and intersection, using an AVL tree.
